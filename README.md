# myVersion
  A simplified Image Recognition software written to understand the concepts of Machine Learning, Neural Networks and AI.
  
# Problem
  The UI has a canvas that will aloow the user to drag and drop an image.
  Want to read the image data, make observations and let the user label the image.
  As the algorithm learn the labels and the observations it tries to label new images dropped onto the canvas.
  The predictions should get more accurate as the data increases
  
 # Solution
  
  Pixelize the image and set a threshold
  Define minimum bounding box for the image
  Calculate the Aspect Ratio and Mass of the object in the image and store the observations
